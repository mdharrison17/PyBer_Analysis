##Module 5 Challenge PybBer Ride Fare Data Analysis

Summary: Using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Jupyter Notebook to create summary dataframe and Multi Line Graph to analyze rides and fares for different cities types over a date range.  Using knowledge of groupby, pivot, sample, and resent index to acheive some of the analtyical tasks.

Analysis Results:

Summary Data Frame
The summary data frame shows that Urban has the most drivers, most rides and the highest overall total fares; however, the average fare per ride is the lowest.  Urban data suggest they do more frequent and cheaper rides than rural or suburban cities.  Rural has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares; however, they do have the highest fare per ride and driver.  Suburban is in the middle of Rural and Urban.  Unlike the Multi Graph line, the data frame summary only gives you a snap shot; it does not show trends over time.  

Summary Multi Line Graph
From the graph, it shows the maximum fare for each city is around the end of February.  Rural consistently has the lowest fares over time and Urban consistently has the highest fares over time.  The rise and fall of fares for each City Type are independent of each other.
